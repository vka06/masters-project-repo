## Named Entity Recognition with BERT, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and TinyBERT for Efficient Performance

The project shows the use of various transformer based models for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CoNLL-2003 dataset. The models are BERT, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and TinyBERT. The goal is to evaluate the performance of these models on recognizing entities such as persons, organizations, locations, and miscellaneous entities.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Datasets
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seqeval (for evaluation)

You can install the required libraries with the following command:
```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch seqeval matplotlib numpy
